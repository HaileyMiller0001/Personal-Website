I also had to add in a shadow affect and do a drastic long job on creating the buttons design on CSS. </h5>

My current lab at the moment is Web Development. Web Development has allowed me to learn about the true nature of computers such as learning JavasScript, HTML, and CSS. And from that I have learned quite a few things. At CART I have even been taught how to be professional in the real world.I am currently in highschool and am graduationg in the year 2021. After graduating I will attend a community college to help me slow down the process of moving to quickly to a College University. Afterward I am intending on finding a Carreer in Programming</h5>
