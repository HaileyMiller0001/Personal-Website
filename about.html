                        <h5>Hello my name is Hailey Miller and Im 17 years old. I am currently a student from the School of Clovis North, and will graduate in the year 2021.As you read from my previous page I currently am enrolled at CART, and am taking the Web Devevelopment class. I have learned so much from that class, as to things such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I beleive that after highschool I will be taking community collge in order to help get ready for a College University. I learned as far as to make my own personal profile using CSS and HTML. Currently I am a student enrolled at the Center of Advanced Research and Technology.The reason I applied for this lab was becuase I believe that knowing a lot about computers would be beneficial later in life. Especially when your involved in a work field that requires you to use computers.Next Year I will either be applying for CART again or College classes in my highschool year.In addition to my work life, I enjoy many hobbies such as gymnastics, baking, cooking, and drawing.When it comes to baking and cooking, one of my favorite dishes to make is Gnochii and St. Joseph Zeppole.I have also been taking gymnastics for about 5 years and have massivly improved of my bar flips.I have even won several medals and trophies.
